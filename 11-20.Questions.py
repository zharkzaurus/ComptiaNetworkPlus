    print(" NO:11 = NO:12 = B.Multiple switches\nExplanation: Switches are used in the layer 2 and if you use STP to create a redundancy between switches in case of hardware failure\n NO:13 = A.show interface\nExplanation: This command shows the status and configuration of the LACP bundle\n  NO:14 = B./21\nExplanation: /21 has a subnet of 255.255.248 and is leaving 3 bits to use so it adds up to 7\n NO:15 = C.HIPS\nExplanation: HIPS(host-based Intrusion Prevention System) protects your system from malware and unwatned activity\n  HNO:16 = A.Captive portal\nExplanation: Captive portal is a webpage that the user of a public network is required to view and interact with before they can access the network\n NO:17 = E.RADIUS,F.TACACS+\nExplanation: RADIUS and TACACS+ uses the AAA authentication Authorization, Authentication, and Accounting\n NO:18 = B.A bottom-up approach\nExplanation:A bottom-up approach is that when you have a trouble shooting issue you are going from the physical layer up to the application layer\n NO:19 = A.If MDIX is enabled on the new switch\nExplanation: MDIX(medium-dependent interface/MDI crossover) it automizes whenever you need to use a crossover or a straight through cable so you dont have to worry about what cable you need to use\n NO:20 = E.A hot site\nExplanation: A hot site is a site that is running everything constantly being able to change between the main and the side one simple and quick in case of an event that afects one of the sites")
