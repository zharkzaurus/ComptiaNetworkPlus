answer = input(print("do you have your answers yes/no"))
if answer == "yes":
    print(" NO:31 = D.Humidity,F.Temperature\nExplanation: Enviromantal issues that data centers have to deal with are usually humidity and temperature so administrators set up sensors to detect when one of them was off balance.")
    print(" NO:32 = A.Channel bonding\nExplanation: Channel bonding is used whenever there is multiple AP(Acess Points) and you want to strenghten their signal and not have them overlap themselves")
    print(" NO:33 = A.Single-mode fiber\nExplanation: A single-mode fiber carries a single beam of light making it simple for information to get through without  a delay")
