environmental messages about specific devices across the network?
A. 23
B. 53
C. 389
D. 514
E. 3306

QUESTION NO: 549

the following meets these requirements?
A. SIEM
B. Syslog
C. NetFlow
D. SNMPv3

QUESTION NO: 550

QUESTION NO: 541
Answer: B
Explanation: Data Link
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer of the OSI model. It is used to identify devices on a network at the hardware level.

QUESTION NO: 542
Answer: A
Explanation: VLAN
To ensure no network settings persist when sending a switch to a remote site to be reused, the administrator needs to delete VLAN information. VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) configurations are stored in the switch's database and need to be removed to prevent any residual network settings from affecting the new deployment.

QUESTION NO: 543
Answer: A
Explanation: Install an additional NIC and configure LACP.
To address the concern about traffic exceeding 1GB on the server without higher-throughput NICs, the best solution is to install an additional NIC and configure Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). LACP allows multiple physical Ethernet links to be bundled together into a single logical link, providing increased bandwidth and redundancy.

QUESTION NO: 544
Answer: C
Explanation: Simplified network management
One of the benefits of the spine-and-leaf network topology is simplified network management. In a spine-and-leaf topology, each leaf switch is connected to every spine switch, forming a non-blocking, fully connected architecture. This design simplifies network management by providing predictable, deterministic paths for traffic, making it easier to scale and manage large networks.

QUESTION NO: 545
Answer: C
Explanation: 802.11g
If the laptop can only connect at a maximum speed of 11 Mbps, it is most likely using the 802.11g wireless standard. 802.11g operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and supports data rates up to 54 Mbps. While it is backward compatible with 802.11b devices, the maximum speed of 11 Mbps suggests that the laptop is using the older 802.11g standard.

QUESTION NO: 546
Answer: C, E
Explanation: QSFP+ and Cat 6a
To achieve 40GB of network throughput, the server can use the following combinations of cables and transceivers:
1. QSFP+ (Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable Plus) transceivers, which support data rates of up to 40 Gbps.
2. Cat 6a (Category 6a) cables, which are capable of supporting 10GBASE-T Ethernet and can handle the bandwidth required for 40GB network throughput.

QUESTION NO: 547
Answer: A
Explanation: Verify the services are restored.
After resolving a network outage and verifying that all users can access resources, the next step in the network troubleshooting methodology is to verify that the services affected by the outage are fully restored. This ensures that the network is functioning correctly and that users can continue to perform their tasks without interruption.

QUESTION NO: 548
Answer: D
Explanation: 514
Port 514 is most likely used to send availability and environmental messages about specific devices across the network. Port 514 is commonly associated with the syslog protocol, which is used for sending log messages from network devices to a centralized syslog server for monitoring and analysis.

QUESTION NO: 549
Answer: D
Explanation: SNMPv3
SNMPv3 (Simple Network Management Protocol version 3) meets the requirements of providing authentication and encryption for device monitoring to enhance network visibility. SNMPv3 adds security features such as authentication and encryption to the SNMP protocol, ensuring that device monitoring data is transmitted securely over the network.

QUESTION NO: 550
Answer: B. 172.18.0.0/10
Explanation: 172.18.0.0/10
When configuring a firewall using NAT with PAT (Port Address Translation), it's best to use a private IP address range for the LAN interface. The range 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 falls within the private IP address space designated by RFC 1918. Among the options provided, the best suited subnet for the LAN interface is 172.18.0.0/10, which provides a large address space for network devices while maintaining compatibility with NAT/PAT.
