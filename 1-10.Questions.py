if answer == 'yes':
    print("NO:1 = C.Warm site\nExplanation: Warm site means that some services are up and running meaning that the recovery site dosen't have everything running just parts of it.\nNO:2 = B.STP\nExplanation: STP(Spanning Tree Protocol) is used to connect multiple switches, prevents loops and redudancy in case a switch fails.\nNO:3 = B.BGP\nExplanation: BGP(Border Gateway Protocol) is a set of rules that find the best route for data trasmission on the internet.\nNO:4 = A.Wireless controller\nExplanation: A wireless controller is a device used to manage wireless access points (APs) in different locations.\nNO:5 = A.SNMPv3\nExplanation:SNMPv3(Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3) is the version of SNMP but encrypted and more secure.\nNO:6 = D.DSCP\nExplanation:DSCP(Differentiated Services Code Point) is a way to classify and manage network traffic to provide QoS(Quality of Service in Layer 3 IP networks.\nNO:7 = Attenuation\nExplanation: Attenuation is the loss of signal strenght in networking cables or connections.\nNO:8 = A. VLAN\nExplanation: VLAN(Virtual Local Area Network) it is used to split computers into different VLANS so a broadcast can comunicate to only those in the VLAN and separating the messages to not be recieved to people in another VLAN.\nNO:9 = B./26\nExplanation: as /26 subnet is 255.255.255.192 subnet mask leaving 6 bits for hosts if you add all of the remaining bits you will end up with 63.\nNO:10 = A.Email\nExplanation an MX record is a Mail Exchange record which is used to direct emails to a mail server.")
