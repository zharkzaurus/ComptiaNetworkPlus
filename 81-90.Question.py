    print("NO:81 = B.Reverse Address Resolution Protocol\n Explanation: Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is a protocol used to map a MAC address to an IP address. When a device needs to communicate with another device on the network, it sends an ARP request to get the MAC address of the destination device.")
