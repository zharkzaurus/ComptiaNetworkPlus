    print(" NO:21 = A.SLAAC\nExplanation: SLAAC(Stateless Address Auto Configuration) The preferred method of assigning IP addresses in an IPv6 network\n NO:22 = B.Latency\nExplanation: Latency is whenever packets are arriving too slowly into their destination\nNO:23 = A.A single collision domain\n Explantion: Hubs are half duplex meaning that they can send and recieve information one at a time it cannot happen together\n NO:24 = B.Gathering information\n Explanation: The trouble shooting methodology is:\n 1.Identify the Problem\n 2.Develop a Theory\n 3.Test the Theory\n 4.Plan of Action\n 5.Implement the Solution\n 6.Verify System Functionality\n 7.Document the Issue\n NO:25 = C.channel overlap is ocurring\nExplanation:Channel overlap happened whenever 2 or more AP(Access Points) are overlapping WiFi channels only in the 2.4 GHz band and they are separated by less than 20 MHz\n NO:27 = A.Subnet mask\nExplanation: A subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 and ranges from hosts depending on the amount of bits left in the subnet\n NO:28 = A, C\nExplanation: Jitter is caused whenever packets don't get at the time they are supposed to, and QoS figuration is able to prioritize phones or anything that is needed\n NO:29 = A.PTR\nExplanation: A PTR(DNS pointer record) provides the domain name associated with an IP address\n NO:30 = A.Session\nExplanation: A.The session layer is used to allow users on different machines to establish active communication sessions between them")
