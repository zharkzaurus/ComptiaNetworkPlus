QUESTION NO: 221 = D
Explanation: The executive's concern about the amount of data that must be reentered after a fire in the data center relates to "RPO" (Recovery Point Objective). RPO refers to the acceptable amount of data loss measured in time before the disaster occurs.

QUESTION NO: 222 = A
Explanation: The requirement to disallow associated stations from communicating with each other on a wireless network serving guests can be accomplished with "Wireless client isolation." This feature isolates wireless clients from each other while still allowing access to the Internet.

QUESTION NO: 223 = A
Explanation: The valid alternative to maintain a deployed proxy technology while saving physical space in the data center by moving the network service to the virtualization infrastructure is "NFV" (Network Functions Virtualization). NFV allows network services, such as proxies, to be virtualized and run on commodity hardware.

QUESTION NO: 224 = B
Explanation: Among the given options, the wireless frequency that would allow for the LEAST signal attenuation, especially when contending with multiple types of building materials, is "5GHz." The higher frequency of 5GHz offers better performance and less interference compared to 2.4GHz.

QUESTION NO: 225 = D
Explanation: The device that the network administrator would MOST likely configure to provide Layer 2 connectivity to various endpoints, including several WAPs (Wireless Access Points), is a "Switch." Switches operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model and are commonly used for local network connectivity.

QUESTION NO: 226 = C
Explanation: In a remote area where cable and DSL services are unavailable, the NEXT best solution to provide services without adding external infrastructure is "Satellite" internet service. Satellite internet can provide broadband connectivity to remote locations using satellite technology.

QUESTION NO: 227 = B
Explanation: The MOST appropriate shortened version of the given IPv6 address "ef82:0000:0000:0000:0000:1ab1:1234:1bc2" is "ef82:0::1ab1:1234:1bc2." In IPv6, consecutive groups of zeros within an address can be replaced with "::" to shorten the representation.

QUESTION NO: 228 = D
Explanation: For secure communication between the new datacenter and the old datacenter in a different region, the BEST access method would be a "Site-to-site VPN" (Virtual Private Network). A site-to-site VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection between two or more networks over the internet.

QUESTION NO: 229 = B
Explanation: The DNS record that works as an alias to another record is "CNAME" (Canonical Name). A CNAME record maps an alias (or nickname) to the canonical name (or true name) of another domain.

QUESTION NO: 230 = C
Explanation: For upgrading the current wireless network solution to achieve better performance and support the 5GHz radio band, "802.11n" should be considered as an option. 802.11n provides improved performance and supports the 5GHz frequency band, offering higher data rates and better throughput compared to older standards like 802.11b and 802.11g
