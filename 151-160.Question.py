    print("NO:151 = C. 5GHz\n Explanation: Microwaves typically operate at 2.4GHz, which can cause interference with Wi-Fi signals in the same frequency range. By utilizing the 5GHz frequency for the WLAN, the technician can minimize interference from the microwave, as it operates on a different frequency band.")

This helps in optimizing performance and reliability of the network.")
    print("NO:156 = A.Reduce the wireless power levels\n Explanation: Wireless Client Isolation is a security feature that prevents wireless clients from communicating with one another. This feature is useful for guest and BYOD SSIDs adding a level of security to limit attacks and threats between devices connected to the wireless networks.")
